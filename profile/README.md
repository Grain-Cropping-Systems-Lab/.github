We conduct applied research and produce extension information related to grain cropping systems in the state of California. Our work strives to: 1) leverage existing knowledge and emerging technology to solve practical problems; 2) produce outcomes that inform both production and environmental concerns; and 3) communicate these outcomes in farmer-accessible formats as well as to the broader scientific community.
